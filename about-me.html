            <p>
                I have worked on several projects for Bank of America in the two years I have worked for them. Many of
                these
                projects focused on developing the UI for
                several programs, including a data cache, event signaller, margin viewer, and most recently, a
                predictive
                monitoring system for all of the bank's applications!
                As a game developer, however, I have worked on several smaller games for various game jams and bootcamp
                courses
                as well as one larger game, which will be
                released later this year! For more information on the game jams I have taken part in, as well as any
                updates on
                future projects I make, I recommend visiting
                <span><a class="about-me-link" href="#">my itch page here</a></span>.

                Despite my professional experience, I don't just make games and software. I also enjoy playing videogames. 
                Some of my favorites include Minecraft and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. When it comes to multiplayer, I 
                also play Overwatch 2, Sea of Thieves, Halo Infinite, and a handful of smaller indie titles depending on what
                everyone else is playing at the time. As for single player, I like to play whatever game I want (currently
                No Man's Sky). I could go on about what games I play, but I'll leave it at that in the interest of page length.
                For many of the games I have listed, I like to play them on PC, however every once in a while, I like to play
                games on Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and Playstation 5. One last thing to note is I will also stream or post videos
                about the games I play. You can check them out for yourself by visiting <span><a class="about-me-link" href="#">my YouTube page</a></a></span>.
