            I have worked on several projects for Bank of America in the two years I have worked for them. Many of these projects focused on developing the UI for 
            several programs, including a data cache, event signaller, margin viewer, and most recently, a predictive monitoring system for all of the bank's applications!
            As a game developer, however, I have worked on several smaller games for various game jams and bootcamp courses as well as one larger game, which will be
            released later this year! For more information on the game jams I have taken part in, as well as any updates on future projects I make, I recommend visiting
